Description: When causal quantities are not identifiable from the observed data, it still may be possible 
            to bound these quantities using the observed data. We outline a class of problems for which the 
            derivation of tight bounds is always a linear programming problem and can therefore, at least 
            theoretically, be solved using a symbolic linear optimizer. We provide a user friendly 
            graphical interface for setting up such problems via directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which only 
            allow for problems within this class to be depicted. The user can then define linear constraints 
            to further refine their assumptions to meet their specific problem, and then specify a causal 
            query using a text interface. The program converts this user defined DAG, query, and constraints, 
            and returns tight bounds. The bounds can be converted to R functions to evaluate them for 
            specific datasets, and to latex code for publication.
