Description: When causal quantities are not identifiable from the observed data, it still may be possible 
            to bound these quantities using the observed data. We outline a class of problems for which the 
            derivation of tight bounds is always a linear programming problem and can therefore, at least 
            theoretically, be solved using Balke's optimizer. Using this class, we provide a user friendly 
            graphical interface for setting up such problems via DAGs, which only allow for problems within 
            this class to be depicted. The user can then define linear constraints to further refine their 
            DAG to meet their specific problem. The program converts this user defined DAG and constraints, 
            and, using Balke's algorithm, returns tight bounds.
